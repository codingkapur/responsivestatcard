#### My process
  Before I even started writing the code, I thought this would be done in 30 mins tops but when i actually got to it, I realized that was not going to be the case. It was easy to set up a desktop version but when I got to making it responsive with media queries, I got lost in the jumble of the code. So I scrapped all of it and started again. 
  
 I have been following tutorials and a couoke of courses, but most of time was being spent learning javascript. But doing this project made me realize that a good grasp of html and css is necessary and can only be built by doing projects. 
  
  After restarting the project 2 times, I was finally able to come up with something that was up to my satisfaction. The important thing was to finish the project even if i couldnt make it perfect, and upload it here. 

So success!

##### Built with

HTML to layout the structure. 
Css flexbox and grid to create the layout. 

###### What I learned

Finish building projects, get serotonin.

### Continued development

I wasn't able to give the info side of the card and the image side of the card equal widths. That bothered me quite a lot and I will have to find out what i might be doing wrong.
